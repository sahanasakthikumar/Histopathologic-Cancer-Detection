# High-Performance Computing (HPC) Project

## Overview
This repository showcases **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** techniques for accelerating computations on large datasets and complex algorithms. It demonstrates **parallel programming** using CPU multi-threading, GPU computation with CUDA, and optimized memory management to achieve significant speedups over traditional serial processing.

## Features
- Parallel algorithms for compute-intensive tasks  
- CPU multi-threading to utilize all cores efficiently  
- GPU programming using **CUDA** for massive parallelism  
- Memory optimization for faster data processing  
- Performance benchmarking and comparison with serial execution

## Workflow

1. **Problem Definition**  
   - Identify compute-intensive tasks or algorithms.  
   - Define input datasets and expected outputs.  

2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Clean and format datasets for processing.  
   - Load data efficiently to minimize I/O overhead.  

3. **Parallelization Strategy**  
   - Decide which parts of the code can run concurrently.  
   - Implement **CPU multi-threading** or **GPU kernels**.  

4. **Implementation**  
   - Write parallel code using **Python multiprocessing**, **NumPy optimizations**, or **CUDA C/C++**.  
   - Optimize memory usage to reduce bottlenecks.  

5. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Verify correctness of parallel outputs vs serial results.  
   - Test on small datasets before scaling up.  

6. **Performance Benchmarking**  
   - Measure speedups using timing tools.  
   - Compare **serial vs parallel execution**.  

7. **Optimization**  
   - Fine-tune thread counts, GPU block sizes, and memory allocation.  
   - Apply caching or data prefetching if needed.  

8. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   - Plot execution times and speedup factors.  
   - Document observations for reproducibility.
