# CPU Parallelization with OpenMP

## Overview
Accelerates CNN training using OpenMP for multi-core CPU parallelization. Implements optimized convolution operations in C++.

## Files
- `conv_openmp.cpp` - OpenMP-accelerated convolution kernels
- `cnn_openmp.py` - Python wrapper for C++ functions
- `train_and_save_openmp.py` - Training script with OpenMP

## Key Features
- Parallel matrix multiplication
- Multi-threaded convolution operations
- Parallel batch processing
- 4-core CPU utilization
